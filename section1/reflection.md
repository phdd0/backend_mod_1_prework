## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

     * I found the "read a lot" piece humorous as I started that instinictively at about 8 years of age
     * The breadth of topics and genres I read has increased over the years
     * I never would have doubted that learning is a journey and one intimately
related to the spiritual character of our being on its own journey of ultimately learning, or _not_ learning, as the case may be
     * I wouldn't be at Turing at 45 several years after retiring from the Active Duty Army to compete with much younger folks for a junior role if I didn't have a growth mindset 
     * I love teaching and helping others understand and believe in short breaks

1. How would you print the string `"Hello World!"` to the terminal?

     * Well, I'd:
```
puts "\n"
p "Hello World!"
```

1. What character is used to indicate comments in a ruby file?

     * 'Octothorpe' often known in the US as the 'pound' or 'hash' sign '#'

1. Explain the difference between an integer and a float?

     * An integer is a counting number, usually excluding zero: 1, 2, 3
       and is equivalent to the integer component of a float signifying a high
       precision zero (as in 12.0000003) which truncates the error to store many          fewer bits
     * All rationals are floats, except rationals equivalent to 1
     * Floats are composed of digits signifying amounts of decreasingly sized            fractions of ten which are then summed to determine the non-integer numeric        portion of the float which is always strictly < 1, the integer component of        the float and a seperator
     * Essentially, the difference between an integer and a float is precision            usually enabled by technological and engineering advances and how that            requires extra bits to store versus storing an integer only
     * From an arithmatic standpoint it's the difference created by the defitions        of the integers and the rationals specifically

1. In the space below, create a variable `animal` that holds the string `"zebra"`

     * ```
       animal = "zebra"
       ```
       
1. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?

    * ```
      p animal
      ```

1. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.

    * Interpolation refers to really a composition of function - that's what it's called in mathamatics when things like the Ruby interpreter VM takes
    
    ```
    print "This is string " + "#{interpolation}" + " because 
    ```

1. What method is used to get input from a user?

1. Name and describe two common string methods:
