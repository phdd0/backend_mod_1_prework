author mistake first time typing the above: 'ex4.rb:14: undefined local var or 
method 'carpool_capacity' for main:Object (NameError). Hypothesis: author 
forgot to defiine the var he had in mind for capacity of the whole pool. He 
must simply have forgotten to declare it. I will try and gen this error by 
commenting out. will document my test here: 

I got:

4vrn.rb:23:in `<main>': undefined local variable or method 
`pool_cap' for main:Object (NameError)

Hypothesis correct...

Author says to use line numbers and explain: pretty simple, the interpreter 
reads and complies with instructions a line at a time. when it gets to the line
where an undefined variable is called, it generates this error. that way the
programmer knows where the error is occuring approximately in his/her/their
instructions to machine.

more drills:

1. 4.0 was not necessary and wouldn't be for this program that needs only ints
not floats. if we swap 4.0 for 4 result is the same.
