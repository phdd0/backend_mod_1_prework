# In the below exercises, write code that achieves
# the desired result. To check your work, run this
# file by entering the following command in your
# terminal: `ruby section1/exercises/numbers.rb`

# Example: Write code that prints the result of the sum of 2 and 2:
puts "\n"
puts "Here is an example of code that prints the result of the sum of 2 and 2:" + "\n"
print "2 + 2 is #{2 + 2}" + " is an example of string interpolation." + "\n\n"

# Write code that prints the result of 7 subtracted from 83:
puts "\n"
puts "This prints the result of 7 subtracted from 83" + " which is " + "#{83 - 7}" + 
" and is also an" + "\n" + "example of string interpolation." + "\n\n"

# Write code that prints the result of 6 multiplied by 53:
puts "\n"
puts "This prints the result of 6 multiplied by 53" + " which is " + "#{6 * 53}" + 
" and is an" + "\n" + "example of a commutative operation, unlike with arrays!" + "\n\n"

# Write code that prints the result of the modulo of 10 into 54:
puts "\n"
puts "This prints the result of modulo 10 into 54" + " which is " + "#{54 % 10}" + 
" and which shows" + "\n" + "that 'A into B' means 'B / A' so that in turn " + "'B % A' means the 'remainder" + "\n" + "of B / A'" + "\n\n"
