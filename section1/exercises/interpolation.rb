# In the below exercises, write code that achieves
# the desired result. To check your work, run this
# file by entering the following command in your terminal:
# `ruby section1/exercises/interpolation.rb`

# Example: Write code that uses the variables below to 
# form a string that reads "The Chudley Cannons are 
# Ron's favorite Quidditch team":
name = "Ron"
team = "Chudley Cannons"
puts "\n"
puts "The #{team} are #{name}'s favorite Quidditch team." + "\n\n"
puts "##########################################################################"

# Write code that uses the variables below to form a string 
# that reads "The quick red fox jumped over the lazy brown dog":
speedy = "quick red fox"
slow_poke = "lazy brown dog"
puts "\n"
puts "The " + "#{speedy}" + " jumped over the " + "#{slow_poke}" + "\n\n"
puts "##########################################################################"

# Write code that uses the variables below to form a string 
# that reads "In a predictable result, the tortoise beat the hare!":
slow_poke = "tortoise"
speedy = "hare"
puts "\n"
puts "In a predictable result, the " + "#{slow_poke}" + " beat the " + 
"#{speedy}!" + "\n\n"
puts "##########################################################################"

# You Do: Declare three variables, name/content/data type of your 
# choice. Think carefully about what you name the variables. Remember, 
# the goal is to be concise but descriptive (it's a hard balance!) Then, 
# log out ONE sentence that incorporates all THREE variables.

   # That is how I met the requirements with the sentence I constructed
   # for variables.rb about whether I was hungry and how many pets
   # less than some number I have, which met but exceeded the 
   # requirement to store data types appropriate to the already
   # named variables and print them (copied below):

     # You Do: Declare three variables, named 'first_name', 'is_hungry' and 
     # 'number_of_pets'. Store the appropriate data types in each. Print all      # three variables to the terminal.
     puts "\n"
     first_name = "Paul"
     is_hungry = true
     number_of_pets = 1
     puts "It is " + "#{is_hungry}" + " that " + "#{first_name}" + " is hungry and has exactly less than " + "#{number_of_pets}" + " pet!" + "\n\n"
