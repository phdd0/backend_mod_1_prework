 ## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

    - Do yourself a favor, read this first before you read my answer: https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.07068
    - The title of the above is: "Talent vs Luck: the role of randomness in success and failure"
    - Also see this SCIAM piece: https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/beautiful-minds/the-role-of-luck-in-life-success-is-far-greater-than-we-realized/   
    - None of this is new to me or anyone
    - I first ran into this pyschobabble by Dweck at Microsoft, a HUGE proponent of said psychobabble
    - The useful stuff she says is obvious to anyone
    - Other stuff she says wouldn't help anyone really
    - Realizing I could learn and grow as Dweck wants to "help" us do was fundamental in my childhood instincts and I didn't need modern era corporate psychobabble theories to inculcate the values she espouses that any driven person would apply pretty much by instinct
    - If I didn't have a "growth mindset" I'd not have:
        1. Become licensed to operate especially the electric plant of a nuclear PWR
        2. Gotten a Bachelor's in Philosophy and a Master's in Engineering, on purpose
        3. Learned Arabic and left the Nuclear Navy and entered the US Intelligence Community
        4. Applied to Turing at all
        5. Left the Navy the way I did and sliding over to the Army the way I did and having the career I did
    - Despite the job market, including MSFT, peddling this Dweck twaddle, that market and none of the corporations in it actually believe in the basics of what Dweck alleges
    - If they did, there wouldn't be 27 million Americans in the "hidden labor market" being ignored by these Dweck disciples because it's patently clear NONE OF THEM believe this "growth mindset" business as if they did they'd hire for ability, aptitude and skill. NOT EXPERIENCE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
    - I had and displayed a "growth mindset" starting in 3rd grade when I got a hold of adult level books around 1984
    - I LOVE my "growth mindset" but REFUSE to call it that because this psychologist (read: pseudoscience) AND Microsoft does, I think as I've grown into adulthood I simply thought of it as "learning" and thus couldn't generate an insipid boring bestseller for the masses
 
2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

    - Please see the above. How about that paper on Talent vs Luck? The did the sim in NetLogo, a langauge I'm familiar with and have used likely due to my "growth mindset"

3. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?

    - a hash is an unordered collection of indexed values, an array is an unordered list of values

4. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.

    - Use `pet_store = {lizards: 1, dogs: 2, cats: 3, hamsterbedding: 983232412387392347}`

5. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?

    - Use `states["IA"]`

6. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?

    - states.keys and states.values returns those respectively

7. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?

    - If I wanted to append say a row of data from a database and use the appropriate column field headings as indices I'd use a hash over an array every time
    - A hash is better than an array as to append input data to a database you need keys - i.e. column headers assuming a row and not a columnar dbase

8. What questions do you still have about hashes?

    - I'm a little foggy about getting all the uses out of them with methods and getting scope right etc.
